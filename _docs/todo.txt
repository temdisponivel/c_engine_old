fix all the "todo:" in code
make cube appear in scene and rotate properly (being loaded from the obj file) ** (need to create the index buffer)

better material (relative paths to texture and shaders, maybe hot reload)
better error handling
fix release stuff

maybe load materials from string buffer instead of FILE?

maybe put all shaders into one file and parse at runtime (just like shader lab)?

Because as of this moment, the material is telling the game all the uniforms, properties, etc
this should really be done in the shader. The material should only "read" what the shader exposes
and change the values of the properties

implement offset + wrap

add options to change DEPTH TEST and DEPTH_FUNC (and possible other similar features) on the material to be used!
